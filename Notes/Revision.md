redo all the exercises in quizes, labs and tests.

Data structure:
Array, List, Double-linked list, stack, queue, string.
Tree, priority queue(heap), graph.

Spend time on lectures and lab problems, and UNDERSTAND!
Solve the easy problems first!

## Course Review 

Lecture 1:
: The time complexity of the recursion.

Lecture 2: 
: Foundations of algorithm analysis (RAM model)
Initialization, Arithmetic, Comparison, Memory access, Random
Cost analysis: time and space
Correctness analysis.

Lectures 3:
: Selection Sort
Insertion sort / Shell sort
Bubble sort
Heap sort (tree)
Merge sort: 逆序对
Quick Sort: expected and average, 第K小个数

Lecture 4:
: Linked list. 
double linked list.
remember the complexity is always larger than $O(n)$

Lecture 5:
: Stack (FILO):implementation, applications(balanced delimiters, arithmetic experessions)
Queue(FIFO)
Testing the in and out order.
The circular queue. (when is the queue empty?). Remember the rear pointer always point to null.

Lecture 6:
: String.
String search with Brute force, KMP(FSA), Robin Carp.

Lecture 7:
: Tree definitions
Binary Tree, complete binary tree (n node with height O(log n))
Application: the Huffman encoding
traversal of the tree.

Lecture 8:
: Advanced Binary Tree
Priority queue, O(n) build heap (pointerless vs. pointer)
Binary tree and balanced binary tree. (find kth smallest)

Lecture 9:
: dircetional?
Loop?
weight?
shortest path
topological order(DAG)
smallest tree
SCC
