# Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis

## Author
Hi! My name is Lumi. The name came from my Chinese name Luming. 
I am currently a student in SUSTech, majoring in Bioinformatics. 
I'm very interested in biology and computer science, that's the 
main reason I chose this major and this cours.

## About the Course
Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis is a course offered by the Computer Science and 
Engineering Department of SUSTech, taught by Prof.Tang Bo. It gained fame in the school
as the toughest course in all SUSTech, and tortures over 200 students in computer 
science related majors. Although our major requires us to take the not-so-hard ver. of this 
course, I would like to challenge myself and chose this harder ver. Hoping to learn more 
and be stronger than I was before.

## Why a Github repo???
This Github repo is purely for recording my hard but happy experience of learning DSAA. I will
put all my codes in here, and make the repository public after this course ends (to prevent 
anyone from plagiarizing my homework). But maybe my learning experience can be useful to those 
who choose this course in the future, and have little coding experience like me. I hope my 
experiences, no matter good or bad, can help those who choose this course, and let them know 
that they are not alone.
